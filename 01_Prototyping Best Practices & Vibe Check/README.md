## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE8 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE8/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!


#### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Provided a simple decision to be made
    - Aspect Tested: The functionality if it was able to help make decisions
2. Look at the options suggested and see if they are relevant
    - Aspect Tested: The options coming in should be relevant to the decision being made. 
3. Evaluate the options w.r.t criterion and have a correct way to evaluage weightages for the criteria
    - Aspect Tested: Accurate way to have relevant criterion and assign weightage as how much important it is to the user
4. If I give weightages not adding up to 100 or exceeding 100 how does the system react?
    - Aspect Tested: Weights are a zero sum game. Its easy to give full weightage to all the options. Does the system catch and force the user to prioritize the criterion
5. Provide the decision made and the action plan for the decision made
    - Aspect Tested: Does the system pick a right / relevant decision and how realistic is the action plan suggested w.r.t the decision made. Is it readable?

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

#### ❓Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
##### ✅ Answer:
Vibe checking is that "Vibe" checking. 
- It is useful to see how the system is functioning in general. 
- However, it cannot guarantee if the system will be accurate and reliable all the time. 
- It may not catch hallucination of the systems. 
- It is very brute force and may not cover all the use cases

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL):

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.



> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1
##### Adjustments Made:
-My initial version was very rudimentary. It had everything taking from the user and the decision option prioritization was not great. It made decision alright but it was not really AI driven and was like a calculator doing what is asked of it. 

I made the following changes
1. <b>LLM Integration for Option Suggestions</b>
- When you type your decision, the AI automatically suggests 4-6 relevant options
- You can select from AI suggestions or add your own options
- Suggestions are displayed in an intuitive UI with loading states
2. <b>LLM Integration for Criteria and Weight Suggestions</b>
- After selecting options, the AI suggests relevant criteria with suggested weights
- You can adjust the weights as needed using the weight controls
- Criteria suggestions are based on your specific decision and options
3. <b>Implementation Plan Generation</b>
- After making your decision, the AI generates a detailed implementation plan
- Includes immediate next steps, short-term actions, medium-term milestones, and long-term goals
- Also covers potential challenges, success metrics, and resources needed
- Plan is displayed with markdown formatting for better readability


##### Results:
1. LLM generated options
2. Better decision making
3. Implementation plan in a readable format
4. 
5.


## Submitting Your Homework
### Main Assignment (Activity #1 only)
Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:
1. Pull the latest updates from upstream into the main branch of your AIE8 repo:
    - For your initial repo setup see [00_Setting Up Git/README.md](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE8/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)
    - To get the latest updates from AI Makerspace into your own AIE8 repo, run the following commands:
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git push origin main
    ```
2. **IMPORTANT:** Start Cursor from the `01_Prototyping Best Practices & Vibe Check` folder (you can also use the _File -> Open Folder_ menu option of an existing Cursor window)
3. Create a branch of your `AIE8` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git checkout -b s01-assignment`
4. Edit this `README.md` file (the one in your `AIE8/01_Prototyping Best Practices & Vibe Check` folder)
5. Perform a "Vibe check" evaluation your AI-Engineering-Challenge system using the five questions provided above 
6. For each Activity question:
    - Define the “Aspect Tested”
    - Comment on how your system performed on it. 
7. Provide an answer to `❓Question #1:` after the `✅ Answer:` prompt
8. Add, commit and push your modified `README.md` to your origin repository.

>(NOTE: You should not merge the new document into origin's main branch. This will spare you from update challenges for each future session.)

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub URL to the tracking branch (for example: `s01-assignment`) you created on your AIE8 repo.

### The Advanced Build:
1. Follow all of the steps (Steps 1 - 8) of the Main Assignment above
2. Document what you changed and the results you saw in the `Adjustments Made:` and `Results:` sections of the Advanced Build's Assignment #1
3. Add, commit and push your additional modifications to this `README.md` file to your origin repository.

When submitting your homework, provide the following on the form:
+ The GitHub URL to the tracking branch (for example: `s01-assignment`) you created on your AIE8 repo.
+ The public Vercel URL to your updated Challenge project on your AIE8 repo.
